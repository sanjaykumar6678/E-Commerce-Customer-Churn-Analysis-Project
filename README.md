# E-Commerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Project


This project involves analyzing customer behavior in an e-commerce business to identify factors contributing to customer churn. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies. The analysis is conducted using SQL for data manipulation, querying, and extracting meaningful patterns from a relational database.


 ## Key Objectives:
 
 ## Understand Churn Drivers:

Analyze customer demographics, transaction history, and engagement patterns.
Identify key factors influencing customer churn, such as purchase frequency, average order value, and time since the last purchase.

## Segmentation:

Categorize customers into segments (e.g., loyal, at-risk, churned) based on behavioral metrics.
Create targeted strategies for re-engagement.


## SQL Techniques Applied:
## Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Removed duplicate entries and handled missing data.
Standardized date formats for time-based analyses.

## Churn Metrics:

Calculated key metrics such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values.
Created derived metrics like churn probability scores.

##Advanced Queries:

Used window functions to calculate customer rank and lifetime value.
Performed aggregations to identify trends across customer segments.
